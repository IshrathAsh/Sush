"Feature / Component","IJFMR 2025 Base Paper","Your Project","Notes"
"Frontend GUI","Streamlit-based upload & outputs","Streamlit app (easy local setup)","Both have GUI; your simplified setup remains user-focused"
"Input Types","Video only","Audio and video (auto audio extraction with ffmpeg)","Yours is more flexible—accepts both audio and video"
"Audio Extraction (from video)","Yes (video input processed as audio internally)","Explicit ffmpeg extraction, works with standalone audio files","You provide clear, general support for audio files as well"
"ASR (Speech-to-Text)","Whisper","WhisperX (with diarization support)","WhisperX potentially more robust with better diarization"
"Diarization (Speaker ID)","PyAnnote integration","WhisperX diarization (possibly more streamlined)","Both use modern diarization; approach differs"
"Profanity Filter","Dictionary-based (lemmatization, normalization, wordlist match)","Python dictionary/module for cuss words","Mechanism similar, underlying implementation may differ"
"Output","Transcripts, timestamped cuss word events, analytics","Fully censored media (with beep overlay), delivered from web app","Yours delivers processed/censored file ready for download"
"Beep/Audio Replacement","No (outputs flagged segments only, not censored media)","Yes (overlays beep on detected profanities)","Distinct innovation: your app produces the final, ready-to-publish censored audio/video"
"Immediate User Output","Shows analytics and flagged times","Censored, downloadable file","Yours offers direct download for real-world use"
"Setup & Accessibility","Desktop GUI with Streamlit","Extremely simple, self-contained Streamlit app","Emphasis on easy setup and quick adoption"
"Offline/Local Operation","Yes","Yes","Both support offline/local use"
